# qTimeShifts

Just a demonstration.
It's a cut out from complex scientific data processing app (sensors data by time).

Problem: different loggers generate unsinchronized timestamps to records.
This app is redactor for timeshifts to bring data to astronomical time and then process them.

Qt based GUI MVC app.
No beautiful animations and concurrency. One simple goal.
